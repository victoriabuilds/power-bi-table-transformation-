# Power BI – Table Transformations Project

##  Project Overview
This project demonstrates Power BI data transformation skills using Power Query.
The task involved connecting to multiple CSV files, cleaning data, creating calculated columns,
and preparing the model for reporting.


Key Objectives
1.Create queries to connect to the two new .csv files
2.Name your queries Product Category Lookup and Product 
Subcategory Lookup
3.Confirm that column headers have been promoted and that 
all data types are correct
4.Add a new column to extract all characters before the dash 
("-") in the Product SKU column, and name it ”SKU Type”
5.Update the SKU Type calculation above to return all 
characters before second dash, instead of the first
6.Replace zeros (0) in the Product Style column with “NA”
7.Close and load to your data model
